# MCP Functionality Fix - Merge Instructions

## Overview
This branch contains fixes for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) functionality in the AI Vibe Check Platform. The main issue was that the MCP evaluation dashboard was showing "MCP Error: HTTP 404: Not Found" due to incorrect endpoint configuration and import issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed useMcp Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/useMcp.ts`)
- **Problem**: The hook was making direct HTTP calls to `/api/mcp/http` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated to use proper MCP protocol headers and structure
- **Key Changes**:
  - Added proper MCP protocol headers (`Accept`, `MCP-Protocol-Version`)
  - Updated all HTTP calls to use the correct MCP JSON-RPC format
  - Removed problematic MCP SDK imports that were causing frontend crashes
  - Simplified the connection logic to work with the existing MCP server setup

### 2. Frontend Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Frontend was crashing with "Element type is invalid" errors
- **Solution**: Fixed import paths and removed incompatible MCP SDK imports
- **Result**: Frontend now loads successfully and MCP Evaluation dashboard renders

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working:
- Frontend loads without errors
- MCP Evaluation dashboard renders properly
- Template loading system works (using fallback templates)
- All UI components are functional

### ‚ùå Still Not Working:
- MCP server HTTP endpoint (`/api/mcp/http` returns 404)
- Actual MCP tool calls fail due to endpoint configuration
- MCP server communication is not established

### üîç Root Cause:
The MCP route is configured as `/api/mcp/[transport]` but the hook is calling `/api/mcp/http` directly. The transport parameter handling needs to be fixed in the MCP server configuration.

git add .
git commit -m "Fix MCP functionality and frontend loading issues

- Fix useMcp hook to use proper MCP protocol headers
- Resolve frontend loading errors caused by MCP SDK imports
- Update MCP evaluation dashboard to render properly
- Maintain template loading functionality with fallback system

Note: MCP server HTTP endpoint still needs configuration fix"

# Merge the PR
gh pr merge --squash
```

## Testing After Merge

1. **Frontend Loading**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:3000
   # Verify all tabs load without errors
   ```

2. **MCP Evaluation Dashboard**:
   - Click on "MCP Evaluation" tab
   - Verify it renders without "MCP Error: HTTP 404: Not Found"
   - Check that template loading works (should show fallback templates)

3. **Next Steps for Full MCP Functionality**:
   - Fix the MCP route configuration in `/api/mcp/[transport]/route.ts`
   - Configure the MCP server to properly handle HTTP transport
   - Test actual MCP tool calls

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/hooks/useMcp.ts` - Fixed MCP hook implementation
- `MERGE.md` - This documentation file

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. The existing MCP packages are still installed but not used in the browser environment due to compatibility issues.

## Notes
- The MCP functionality is partially working - the UI renders but server communication needs further configuration
- This fix resolves the immediate frontend loading issues and provides a foundation for full MCP implementation
- Future work needed to complete MCP server HTTP transport configuration
